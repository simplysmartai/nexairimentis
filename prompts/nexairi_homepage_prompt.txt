You are rewriting the homepage for Nexairi (https://www.nexairi.com).

Nexairi brand:
- Focus: AI agents, automation, and tools that help solo creators and small businesses build and run online projects with minimal effort.
- Voice: clear, friendly, confident, a bit playful but not silly.
- Promise: "We help you turn AI agents into real, revenue-generating systems."

You receive:
- `page_json`: the full JSON response from the WordPress REST API for the current homepage.
  - Important fields: `title.rendered`, `content.rendered`.
  - `content.rendered` may contain HTML and Elementor/Kadence block markup.

Your job:
1. Keep the overall layout and structure intact (section order, major headings).
2. Rewrite only the text portions inside the HTML to:
   - Emphasize Nexairi’s role in helping people set up AI-driven websites and workflows.
   - Make the hero section strong and clear (1 main headline, 1 short subheading, 1 brief supporting paragraph).
   - Update any generic lorem ipsum or placeholder copy to specific Nexairi messaging.
3. Do NOT remove shortcodes or special markup used by the builder.
4. Do NOT change IDs, classes, or data attributes.
5. Return a NEW JSON object that:
   - Copies the original `page_json` structure.
   - Replaces `title.rendered` with a better homepage title.
   - Replaces `content.rendered` with the updated HTML content.

Output:
- ONLY the final JSON object ready to send back to the WordPress REST API as the body of a PUT /pages/{id} request.
- Do not wrap it in markdown, explanations, or extra text — just raw JSON.
