Nexairi WordPress Deployment Plan (WordPress 6.6+)
=================================================

1. Prep the site bundle on your computer
   1.1 In File Explorer go to C:\Users\smart\OneDrive\Documents\Side Gig\n8n\websites\nexairi\site.
   1.2 Select every item inside (assets, css, sandbox, lifestyle, mission, etc.).
   1.3 Right-click > Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder and name it nexairi-static.zip. This is the package you will upload.

2. Back up and update WordPress before touching files
   2.1 Log into https://www.nexairi.com/wp-admin with your admin credentials.
   2.2 Dashboard > Updates: apply any WordPress 6.6.x core, plugin, or theme updates so the UI matches current documentation.
   2.3 Tools > Export (All Content) to download an XML backup.
   2.4 If your host offers one-click backups (cPanel, Plesk, Managed WP), trigger a full backup so you can roll back if needed.

3. Prepare a place to store the static bundle inside WordPress
   3.1 Use WP File Manager (or HostGator File Manager) to browse to /public_html/wp-content/.
   3.2 Create /wp-content/nexairi if it does not exist.
   3.3 Upload nexairi-static.zip into wp-content/nexairi, then right-click > Extract. You should now have:
       - wp-content/nexairi/assets
       - wp-content/nexairi/css
       - wp-content/nexairi/mission, /lifestyle, /sports, /technology, /travel, /contact, /privacy
       - wp-content/nexairi/sandbox (with concept pages)
       - wp-content/nexairi/index.html

4. Point the WordPress homepage to the static index.html
   Option A – Block themes:
     4.1 Appearance > Editor > Templates > Front Page > Edit.
     4.2 Insert an “HTML” block and paste: <!-- wp:html --><?php include ABSPATH . 'wp-content/nexairi/index.html'; ?><!-- /wp:html -->
     4.3 Save.
   Option B – Classic themes:
     4.4 Appearance > Theme File Editor, open front-page.php (or index.php) and add the same include inside the loop.

5. Create the rest of the magazine pages with includes
   5.1 Pages > Add New for Our Mission, Lifestyle, Sports, Technology, Travel, Sandbox, Contact, Privacy, Gift Scout, Dog Routine Coach, Trip Builder.
   5.2 Switch the editor to “Code Editor”.
   5.3 Paste the matching include, e.g. <!-- wp:html --><?php include ABSPATH . 'wp-content/nexairi/mission/index.html'; ?><!-- /wp:html -->
   5.4 Publish and confirm permalinks (e.g., /our_mission, /lifestyle, /sandbox/gift-scout).
   5.5 Settings > Reading > set “Homepage” to the page containing the index.html include (if you are not editing the template directly).

6. Register fonts and CSS once
   6.1 Appearance > Editor > Styles > Additional CSS (or Customize > Additional CSS).
   6.2 Paste:
       @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Space+Grotesk:wght@400;600&family=Source+Sans+3:wght@400;500&display=swap');
       @import url('/wp-content/nexairi/css/styles.css');
   6.3 Save.

7. Wire the navigation
   7.1 Appearance > Editor > Navigation (or Menus).
   7.2 Add links to /, /our_mission, /lifestyle, /sports, /technology, /travel, /sandbox, /contact, /privacy.
   7.3 Add submenu items for Sandbox concepts if you like.

8. Keep the Dispatches feed synced
   8.1 Update /wp-content/nexairi/content_html/index.json with the latest story metadata.
   8.2 Confirm https://www.nexairi.com/wp-content/nexairi/content_html/index.json is reachable (the homepage fetches this file).

9. Test the live site
   9.1 Visit https://www.nexairi.com/ in an incognito window and verify the new layout.
   9.2 Click every menu link and Sandbox concept page.
   9.3 Run Lighthouse for performance/accessibility.
   9.4 Test on mobile to ensure the .nx- classes stack correctly.

10. Post-launch checklist
   10.1 Purge caches so visitors see the refresh.
   10.2 Submit the homepage to Google Search Console.
   10.3 Document that static files live in /wp-content/nexairi for future updates.
