Nexairi WordPress Deployment Plan (WordPress 6.6+)
=================================================

1. Prep the site bundle on your computer
   1.1 In File Explorer go to C:\Users\smart\OneDrive\Documents\Side Gig\n8n\websites\nexairi\site.
   1.2 Select every item inside (assets, css, sandbox, tools, index.html, etc.).
   1.3 Right‑click > Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder and name it nexairi-static.zip. This is the package you will upload.

2. Back up and update WordPress before touching files
   2.1 Log into https://www.nexairi.com/wp-admin with your admin credentials.
   2.2 Dashboard > Updates: apply any WordPress 6.6.x core, plugin, or theme updates so the UI matches current documentation.
   2.3 Tools > Export (All Content) to download an XML backup.
   2.4 If your host offers one-click backups (cPanel, Plesk, Managed WP), trigger a full backup so you can roll back if needed.

3. Prepare a place to store the static bundle inside WordPress
   3.1 In wp-admin go to Plugins > Add New Plugin.
   3.2 Install and activate “WP File Manager” (by mndpsingh287) or use your host’s File Manager if it already exists. This plugin is the current lightweight way to drag-and-drop files without FTP.
   3.3 Open WP File Manager (in the left sidebar). You are now looking at /public_html/ (or /home/.../public_html/).
   3.4 Inside wp-content create a new folder named nexairi.
   3.5 Upload nexairi-static.zip into wp-content/nexairi using the Upload button, then right-click the zip > Extract. You should now have:
       - wp-content/nexairi/assets
       - wp-content/nexairi/css
       - wp-content/nexairi/sandbox
       - wp-content/nexairi/tools
       - wp-content/nexairi/index.html (plus other html files)

4. Point the WordPress homepage to the static index.html
   Option A – Block themes (Twenty Twenty-Four, 6.6 default):
     4.1 Go to Appearance > Editor > Templates > Front Page > three-dot menu > Edit.
     4.2 Insert a “HTML” block at the top, paste: <!-- wp:html --><?php include ABSPATH . 'wp-content/nexairi/index.html'; ?><!-- /wp:html -->
     4.3 Save. WordPress will now render the uploaded static file while still running inside the theme.
   Option B – Classic themes:
     4.4 Go to Appearance > Theme File Editor.
     4.5 Select front-page.php (or index.php if a front template does not exist) and add: <?php include ABSPATH . 'wp-content/nexairi/index.html'; ?> inside the loop. Save.
   (If you prefer a fully static front page outside WordPress, change your home directory’s index.php to redirect to /wp-content/nexairi/index.html, but keep a copy so you can restore WordPress admin access.)

5. Create sandbox and concept pages
   5.1 Pages > Add New for each child page (Sandbox, Gift Scout, Dog Routine Coach, Trip Builder).
   5.2 Switch the block editor to “Code Editor” (top-right three-dot menu > Code editor).
   5.3 Replace the default markup with: <!-- wp:html --><?php include ABSPATH . 'wp-content/nexairi/sandbox/index.html'; ?><!-- /wp:html --> (and adjust the include path for each concept page).
   5.4 Publish each page and note the permalinks; they should match /sandbox, /sandbox/gift-scout, etc.
   5.5 Settings > Reading > Set “Homepage” to the page you created in step 4 if you chose the WordPress page approach (instead of template editing).

6. Register fonts and CSS only once
   6.1 Go to Appearance > Editor > Styles > Additional CSS (block themes) or Appearance > Customize > Additional CSS (classic themes).
   6.2 Paste: @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Space+Grotesk:wght@400;600&family=Source+Sans+3:wght@400;500&display=swap');
       @import url('/wp-content/nexairi/css/styles.css');
   6.3 Save. WordPress will now load the Google Fonts and the shared stylesheet for every page.

7. Wire the navigation so visitors can reach the sandbox pages
   7.1 If you are on a block theme: Appearance > Editor > Navigation > select your primary menu.
   7.2 Add menu links pointing to /#sports, /#tech, /sandbox, /sandbox/gift-scout, etc.
   7.3 On classic themes: Appearance > Menus > select the Primary menu > Add the new pages > drag them into position > Save Menu.

8. Upload the content feed for the Stories grid
   8.1 Convert your latest posts into HTML snippets (or use the ones in websites/nexairi/content_html).
   8.2 In WP File Manager open wp-content/nexairi/content_html and upload your updated index.json plus any .html article files.
   8.3 Confirm https://www.nexairi.com/wp-content/nexairi/content_html/index.json is publicly reachable; the homepage fetch() call relies on that exact path.

9. Test everything in the live site
   9.1 Visit https://www.nexairi.com/ in an incognito window and verify the layout, fonts, gradients, and buttons render correctly.
   9.2 Click every navbar link (Sports, Tech, Lifestyle, Travel, Sandbox) to ensure anchors scroll or pages load.
   9.3 Open https://www.nexairi.com/sandbox, https://www.nexairi.com/sandbox/gift-scout, etc., and confirm the detail templates pick up the shared CSS.
   9.4 Use a phone or browser dev tools (⌥+⌘+I / Ctrl+Shift+I > Toggle device toolbar) to confirm mobile responsiveness.
   9.5 Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools > Lighthouse) to check performance/accessibility; verify there are no mixed-content warnings (fonts and CSS are HTTPS).

10. Post-launch checklist
   10.1 Re-enable any caching plugin (WP Super Cache, LiteSpeed, etc.) and purge caches so the new static files are served globally.
   10.2 Submit the homepage URL to Google Search Console if you want the refreshed layout re-indexed quickly.
   10.3 Document where the files live (wp-content/nexairi) so future updates are as easy as replacing the HTML/CSS and re-running the tests above.
